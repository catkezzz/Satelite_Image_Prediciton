# Satelite_Image_Prediciton
## Background & Data Overview
Remote sensing has become an increasingly vital technology for various applications, such as mapping, environmental monitoring, disaster mitigation, and more. Advances in this field, along with the improved quality and accessibility of satellite imagery, have created a growing need for automated interpretation of such data.

The RSI-CB256 dataset contains images from multiple sensors and Google Maps snapshots, representing four categories that reflect the diversity of Earth's landscapes and features:
- Clouds
- Deserts
- Greenery
- Water bodies

This dataset is crucial for supporting the development of classification models capable of accurately and automatically categorizing satellite images, can be found __[here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmoudreda55/satellite-image-classification)__

### Objective
The goals of this project are:
- Develop a deep learning model that can classify satellite images into four categories using the RSI-CB256 dataset.
- Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using accuracy and F1-score metrics, and optimize the model to achieve good generalization on new data.
- Contribute to the advancement of deep learning algorithms in satellite image interpretation.
- Apply the model in real-world scenarios, such as land mapping, area change detection, monitoring specific regions, etc.
